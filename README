Program Description:

In this last program we are required to write out
  CS8BWANG
   WINTER
    2016
with turtle class's turtle in two parts
first part is single turtle draw out all the characters by itslef.
second part is a lot of tutles draw each letter at the same time without wait.

the code for draw out each letter is writtern by us.
we are using penUp, penDown, move methods to characterize the letter.
This part really helps if we write down the letters on the paper and count the steps needed to finish the letter.

for extra credit, i changed the color of the letters and added some custom shapes such as hexgram, sword and a symbol from anime "a world that dirty joke does not exist".


Short Response:

1. the command m followed by a letter will mark the letter at current position.

2. the command ' + (the letter you marked) will go to that mark.

3. the command 'head -5 filename will show the first five lines, 'tail -5 filename will show the last 5 lines.

4. the command scp will do the work.

5. the Rect class's roString will be called.

6. super() will be called first.
